# web_scrapping

The 'news.py' file contains the code for the news application. This application displays the headlines and
summary of different news ranging over various topics such as india news, world news, entertainment
news, etc. These topics also contain different sub topics. For example the entertainment news contains
tv news, music, etc. There is also a search option so that the user can search the news as per his/her
convenience.
This application works on web scrapping. The news is scrapped from google news. The python library
used for this is Beautifulsoup. The front end of this application is coded using the inbuilt tkinter library.
The tkinter library is inbuilt with python and hence it need not be explicitly installed. The packages that
are supposed to be downloaded are :
1.Beautifulsoup
2.requests
3.newspaper
4.nltk
